                <p>Software project management is an essential part of software engineering. Projects
                need to be managed because professional software engineering is always subject to
                organizational budget and schedule constraints. The project manager’s job is to ensure
                that the software project meets and overcomes these constraints as well as delivering
                high-quality software. Good management cannot guarantee project success. However,
                bad management usually results in project failure: the software may be delivered late,
                cost more than originally estimated, or fail to meet the expectations of customers.</p>
                <p>The success criteria for project management obviously vary from project to proj
                    ect but, for most projects, important goals are:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Deliver the software to the customer at the agreed time.</li>
                    <li>Keep overall costs within budget.</li>
                    <li>Deliver software that meets the customer's expectations.</li>
                    <li>Maintain a happy and well-functioning development team.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>These goals are not unique to software engineering but are the goals of all engi
                    neering projects. However, software engineering is different from other types of
                    engineering in a number of ways that make software management particularly chal
                    lenging. Some of these differences are:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The product is intangible A manager of a shipbuilding or a civil engineering
                    project can see the product being developed. If a schedule slips, the effect on
                    the product is visible—parts of the structure are obviously unfinished.
                    Software is intangible. It cannot be seen or touched. Software project managers
                    cannot see progress by simply looking at the artifact that is being constructed.
                    Rather, they rely on others to produce evidence that they can use to review the
                    progress of the work.</li>
                    <li>Large software projects are often ‘one-off’ projects Large software projects are
                    usually different in some ways from previous projects. Therefore, even managers who have a large body of previous experience may find it difficult to anticipate problems. Furthermore, rapid technological changes in computers and
                    communications can make a manager’s experience obsolete. Lessons learned
                    from previous projects may not be transferable to new projects</li>
                    <li>Software processes are variable and organization-specific The engineering
                    process for some types of system, such as bridges and buildings, is well understood. However, software processes vary quite significantly from one organization
                    to another. Although there has been significant progress in process standardization
                    and improvement, we still cannot reliably predict when a particular software
                    process is likely to lead to development problems. This is especially true when the
                    software project is part of a wider systems engineering project.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>Because of these issues, it is not surprising that some software projects are late,
                over budget, and behind schedule. Software systems are often new and technically
                innovative. Engineering projects (such as new transport systems) that are innovative
                often also have schedule problems. Given the difficulties involved, it is perhaps
                remarkable that so many software projects are delivered on time and to budget!</p>
                <p>It is impossible to write a standard job description for a software project manager.
                The job varies tremendously depending on the organization and the software product
                being developed. However, most managers take responsibility at some stage for
                some or all of the following activities:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Project planning Project managers are responsible for planning, estimating and
                    scheduling project development, and assigning people to tasks. They supervise
                    the work to ensure that it is carried out to the required standards and monitor
                    progress to check that the development is on time and within budget</li>
                    <li>Reporting Project managers are usually responsible for reporting on the
                    progress of a project to customers and to the managers of the company developing the software. They have to be able to communicate at a range of levels, from
                    detailed technical information to management summaries. They have to write
                    concise, coherent documents that abstract critical information from detailed
                    project reports. They must be able to present this information during progress
                    reviews.</li>
                    <li>Risk management Project managers have to assess the risks that may affect a
                    project, monitor these risks, and take action when problems arise.</li>
                    <li>People management Project managers are responsible for managing a team of
                    people. They have to choose people for their team and establish ways of work
                    ing that lead to effective team performance</li>
                    <li>Proposal writing The first stage in a software project may involve writing a proposal to win a contract to carry out an item of work. The proposal describes the
                    objectives of the project and how it will be carried out. It usually includes cost
                    and schedule estimates and justifies why the project contract should be awarded
                    to a particular organization or team. Proposal writing is a critical task as the survival of many software companies depends on having enough proposals
                    accepted and contracts awarded. There can be no set guidelines for this task;
                    proposal writing is a skill that you acquire through practice and experience.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>In this chapter, I focus on risk management and people management. Project
                planning is an important topic in its own right, which I discuss in Chapter 23.</p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <p><b>22.1 Risk Management</b></p>
                <p>Risk management is one of the most important jobs for a project manager. Risk
                management involves anticipating risks that might affect the project schedule or the
                quality of the software being developed, and then taking action to avoid these risks
                (Hall, 1998; Ould, 1999). You can think of a risk as something that you’d prefer not
                to have happen. Risks may threaten the project, the software that is being developed,
                or the organization. There are, therefore, three related categories of risk:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Project risks Risks that affect the project schedule or resources. An example of
                    a project risk is the loss of an experienced designer. Finding a replacement
                    designer with appropriate skills and experience may take a long time and, 
                    consequently, the software design will take longer to complete.</li>
                    <li>Product risks Risks that affect the quality or performance of the software being
                    developed. An example of a product risk is the failure of a purchased component
                    to perform as expected. This may affect the overall performance of the system
                    so that it is slower than expected.</li>
                    <li>Business risks Risks that affect the organization developing or procuring the
                    software. For example, a competitor introducing a new product is a business
                    risk. The introduction of a competitive product may mean that the assumptions
                    made about sales of existing software products may be unduly optimistic.</li>
                </ol>
                
                <p>Of course, these risk types overlap. If an experienced programmer leaves a
                project this can be a project risk because, even if they are immediately replaced,
                the schedule will be affected. It inevitably takes time for a new project member
                to understand the work that has been done, so they cannot be immediately productive. Consequently, the delivery of the system may be delayed. The loss of a
                team member can also be a product risk because a replacement may not be as
                experienced and so could make programming errors. Finally, it can be a business
                risk because that programmer’s experience may be crucial in winning new
                contracts</p>
                <p>You should record the results of the risk analysis in the project plan along with a
                consequence analysis, which sets out the consequences of the risk for the project,
                product, and business. Effective risk management makes it easier to cope with
                problems and to ensure that these do not lead to unacceptable budget or schedule
                slippage.</p>
                <p>The specific risks that may affect a project depend on the project and the organizational environment in which the software is being developed. However, there
                are also common risks that are not related to the type of software being developed
                and these can occur in any project. Some of these common risks are shown in
                Figure 22.1.</p>
                <p>Risk management is particularly important for software projects because of the
                inherent uncertainties that most projects face. These stem from loosely defined
                requirements, requirements changes due to changes in customer needs, difficulties in
                estimating the time and resources required for software development, and differences in individual skills. You have to anticipate risks; understand the impact of
                these risks on the project, the product, and the business; and take steps to avoid these
                risks. You may need to draw up contingency plans so that, if the risks do occur, you
                can take immediate recovery action.</p>

                <p><b>Figure 22.1</b> Examples of commonproject, product,and business risks</p>

                <p>An outline of the process of risk management is illustrated in Figure 22.2. It
                involves several stages:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Risk identification You should identify possible project, product, and business
                    risks.</li>
                    <li>Risk analysis You should assess the likelihood and consequences of these risks</li>
                    <li>Risk planning You should make plans to address the risk, either by avoiding it or
                    minimizing its effects on the project.</li>
                    <li>Risk monitoring You should regularly assess the risk and your plans for risk
                    mitigation and revise these when you learn more about the risk.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>You should document the outcomes of the risk management process in a risk
                management plan. This should include a discussion of the risks faced by the project,
                an analysis of these risks, and information on how you propose to manage the risk if
                it seems likely to be a problem.</p>
                <p>The risk management process is an iterative process that continues throughout the
                project. Once you have drawn up an initial risk management plan, you monitor the
                situation to detect emerging risks. As more information about the risks becomes available, you have to reanalyze the risks and decide if the risk priority has changed. You
                may then have to change your plans for risk avoidance and contingency management</p>

                <p><b>Figure 22.2</b> The risk management process</p>

                <p>22.1.1 Risk identification</p>
                <hr>
                <p>Risk identification is the first stage of the risk management process. It is concerned
                with identifying the risks that could pose a major threat to the software engineering
                process, the software being developed, or the development organization. Risk identification may be a team process where a team get together to brainstorm possible
                risks. Alternatively, the project manager may simply use his or her experience to
                identify the most probable or critical risks</p>
                <p>As a starting point for risk identification, a checklist of different types of risk may
                be used. There are at least six types of risk that may be included in a risk checklist:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Technology risks Risks that derive from the software or hardware technologies
                    that are used to develop the system</li>
                    <li>People risks Risks that are associated with the people in the development team.</li>
                    <li>Organizational risks Risks that derive from the organizational environment
                    where the software is being developed.</li>
                    <li>Tools risks Risks that derive from the software tools and other support software
                    used to develop the system.</li>
                    <li>Requirements risks Risks that derive from changes to the customer requirements
                    and the process of managing the requirements change.</li>
                    <li>Estimation risks Risks that derive from the management estimates of the
                    resources required to build the system.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>Figure 22.3 gives some examples of possible risks in each of these categories.
                When you have finished the risk identification process, you should have a long list of
                risks that could occur and which could affect the product, the process, and the business. You then need to prune this list to a manageable size. If you have too many
                risks, it is practically impossible to keep track of all of them.</p>

                <p>22.1.2 Risk analysis</p>
                <hr>
                <p>During the risk analysis process, you have to consider each identified risk and make
                a judgment about the probability and seriousness of that risk. There is no easy way to
                do this. You have to rely on your own judgment and experience of previous projects</p>

                <img src="assets/figure-22.3.png" alt="" height="300px" width="600px">
                <p><b>Figure 22.3</b> Examples of different types of risks</p>
                <p>and the problems that arose in them. It is not possible to make precise, numeric
                assessment of the probability and seriousness of each risk. Rather, you should assign
                the risk to one of a number of bands:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li> The probability of the risk might be assessed as very low ( 10%), low
                    (10–25%), moderate (25–50%), high (50–75%), or very high ( 75%).</li>
                    <li>The effects of the risk might be assessed as catastrophic (threaten the survival of
                    the project), serious (would cause major delays), tolerable (delays are within
                    allowed contingency), or insignificant.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>You should then tabulate the results of this analysis process using a table ordered
                according to the seriousness of the risk. Figure 22.4 illustrates this for the risks that I
                have identified in Figure 22.3. Obviously, the assessment of probability and seriousness is arbitrary here. To make this assessment, you need detailed information about
                the project, the process, the development team, and the organization.</p>
                <p>Of course, both the probability and the assessment of the effects of a risk may
                change as more information about the risk becomes available and as risk management plans are implemented. Therefore, you should update this table during each
                iteration of the risk process.</p>
                <p>Once the risks have been analyzed and ranked, you should assess which of these
                risks are most significant. Your judgment must depend on a combination of the
                probability of the risk arising and the effects of that risk. In general, catastrophic
                risks should always be considered, as should all serious risks that have more than a
                moderate probability of occurrence.</p>

                <img src="assets/figure-22.4.png" alt="" height="300px" width="600px">
                <p><b>Figure 22.4</b> Risk types and examples</p>
                <p>Boehm (1988) recommends identifying and monitoring the top 10 risks, but I
                think that this figure is rather arbitrary. The right number of risks to monitor must
                depend on the project. It might be 5 or it might be 15. However, the number of risks
                chosen for monitoring should be manageable. A very large number of risks would
                simply require too much information to be collected. From the risks identified in
                Figure 22.4, it is appropriate to consider the 8 risks that have catastrophic or serious
                consequences (Figure 22.5).</p>

                <p>22.1.3  Risk planning</p>
                <hr>
                <p>The risk planning process considers each of the key risks that have been identified,
                and develops strategies to manage these risks. For each of the risks, you have to think
                of actions that you might take to minimize the disruption to the project if the problem
                identified in the risk occurs. You also should think about information that you might
                need to collect while monitoring the project so that problems can be anticipated.</p>

                <p><b>Figure 22.5</b> Strategiesto help manage risk</p>
                <p>Again, there is no simple process that can be followed for contingency planning. It
                relies on the judgment and experience of the project manager.</p>

                for the key risks (i.e., those that are serious or intolerable) shown in Figure 22.4.
                These strategies fall into three categories:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Avoidance strategies Following these strategies means that the probability that
                    the risk will arise will be reduced. An example of a risk avoidance strategy is the
                    strategy for dealing with defective components shown in Figure 22.5.</li>
                    <li>Minimization strategies Following these strategies means that the impact of the
                    risk will be reduced. An example of a risk minimization strategy is the strategy
                    for staff illness shown in Figure 22.5.</li>
                    <li>Contingency plans Following these strategies means that you are prepared for
                    the worst and have a strategy in place to deal with it. An example of a contingency strategy is the strategy for organizational financial problems that I have
                    shown in Figure 22.5.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>You can see a clear analogy here with the strategies used in critical systems to
                ensure reliability, security, and safety, where you must avoid, tolerate, or recover
                from failures. Obviously, it is best to use a strategy that avoids the risk. If this is not
                possible, you should use a strategy that reduces the chances that the risk will have
                serious effects. Finally, you should have strategies in place to cope with the risk if it
                arises. These should reduce the overall impact of a risk on the project or product.</p>

                <p>22.1.4  Risk monitoring</p>
                <hr>
                <p>Risk monitoring is the process of checking that your assumptions about the product,
                process, and business risks have not changed. You should regularly assess each of
                the identified risks to decide whether or not that risk is becoming more or less prob
                able. You should also think about whether or not the effects of the risk have changed.
                To do this, you have to look at other factors, such as the number of requirements
                change requests, which give you clues about the risk probability and its effects.
                These factors are obviously dependent on the types of risk. Figure 22.6 gives some
                examples of factors that may be helpful in assessing these risk types.
                You should monitor risks regularly at all stages in a project. At every management
                review, you should consider and discuss each of the key risks separately. You should
                decide if the risk is more or less likely to arise and if the seriousness and consequences of the risk have changed.

                <p><b>22.2 Managing people</b></p>
                <p>The people working in a software organization are its greatest assets. It costs a lot to
                recruit and retain good people and it is up to software managers to ensure that the
                organiza tion gets the best possible return on its investment. In successful companies
                and econ omies, this is achieved when people are respected by the organization and
                are assigned responsibilities that reflect their skills and experience.</p>
                <p>It is important that software project managers understand the technical issues
                that influence the work of software development. Unfortunately, however, good
                software engineers are not necessarily good people managers. Software engineers
                often have strong technical skills but may lack the softer skills that enable them to
                motivate and lead a project development team. As a project manager, you should be
                aware of the potential problems of people management and should try to develop
                people management skills.</p>
                <p>In my view, there are four critical factors in people management:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Consistency People in a project team should all be treated in a comparable way.
                    No one expects all rewards to be identical but people should not feel that their
                    contribution to the organization is undervalued.</li>
                    <li>Respect Different people have different skills and managers should respect these
                    differences. All members of the team should be given an opportunity to make a
                    contribution. In some cases, of course, you will find that people simply don’t fit
                    into a team and they cannot continue, but it is important not to jump to conclu
                    sions about this at an early stage in the project.</li>
                    <li>Inclusion People contribute effectively when they feel that others listen to them
                    and take account of their proposals. It is important to develop a working envi
                    ronment where all views, even those of the most junior staff, are considered.</li>
                    <li>Honesty As a manager, you should always be honest about what is going well
                    and what is going badly in the team. You should also be honest about your level
                    of technical knowledge and willing to defer to staff with more knowledge when
                    necessary. If you try to cover up ignorance or problems you will eventually be
                    found out and will lose the respect of the group.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>People management, in my view, is something that has to be based on experience,
                rather than learned from a book. My aim in this section and the following section on
                teamwork is simply to introduce some of the most important people and team management problems that affect software project management. I hope the material here will
                sensitize you to some of the problems that managers may encounter when dealing with
                teams of technically talented individuals.</p>

                <p>22.2.1  Motivating people</p>
                <hr>
                <p>As a project manager, you need to motivate the people that work with you so that
                they contribute to the best of their abilities. Motivation means organizing the work
                and the working environment to encourage people to work as effectively as possible.
                If people are not motivated, they will not be interested in the work they are doing.
                They will work slowly, be more likely to make mistakes, and will not contribute to
                the broader goals of the team or the organization.</p>
                <p>To provide this encouragement, you should understand a little about what motivates people. Maslow (1954) suggests that people are motivated by satisfying their
                needs. These needs are arranged in a series of levels, as shown in Figure 22.7. The
                lower levels of this hierarchy represent fundamental needs for food, sleep, and so on,
                and the need to feel secure in an environment. Social needs are concerned with the
                need to feel part of a social grouping. Esteem needs represent the need to feel</p>
                respected by others, and self-realization needs are concerned with personal development. People need to satisfy lower-level needs like hunger before the more abstract,
                higher-level needs.

                <img src="assets/figure-22.7.png" alt="" height="300px" width="600px">
                <p><b>Figure 22.7</b> Human needs hierarchy</p>
                <p>People working in software development organizations are not usually hungry or
                thirsty or physically threatened by their environment. Therefore, making sure that
                people’s social, esteem, and self-realization needs are satisfied is most important
                from a management point of view.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>To satisfy social needs, you need to give people time to meet their co-workers
                    and provide places for them to meet. This is relatively easy when all of the
                    members of a development team work in the same place but, increasingly, team
                    members are not located in the same building or even the same town or state.
                    They may work for different organizations or from home most of the time.
                    <p>Social networking systems and teleconferencing can be used to facilitate communications but my experience with electronic systems is that they are most
                    effective once people know each other. You therefore need to arrange some
                    face-to-face meetings early in the project so that people can directly interact
                    with other members of the team. Through this direct interaction, people become
                    part of a social group and accept the goals and priorities of that group.</p></li>
                    <li>To satisfy esteem needs, you need to show people that they are valued by the
                    organization. Public recognition of achievements is a simple yet effective way
                    of doing this. Obviously, people must also feel that they are paid at a level that
                    reflects their skills and experience.</li>
                    <li>Finally, to satisfy self-realization needs, you need to give people responsibility
                    for their work, assign them demanding (but not impossible) tasks, and provide a
                    training programme where people can develop their skills. Training is an important motivating influence as people like to gain new knowledge and learn new
                    skills.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>In Figure 22.8, I illustrate a problem of motivation that managers often have to
                face. In this example, a competent group member loses interest in the work and in
                the group as a whole. The quality of her work falls and becomes unacceptable. This
                situation has to be dealt with quickly. If you don’t sort out the problem, the other
                group members will become dissatisfied and feel that they are doing an unfair share
                of the work.</p>

                <img src="assets//figure-22.8.png" alt="" height="300px" width="600px">
                <p><b>Figure 22.8</b> Individual motivation</p>

                <p>In this example, Alice tries to find out if Dorothy’s personal circumstances could
                be the problem. Personal difficulties commonly affect motivation because people
                cannot concentrate on their work. You may have to give them time and support to
                resolve these issues, although you also have to make it clear that they still have a
                responsibility to their employer.</p>
                <p>Dorothy’s motivation problem is one that is quite common when projects develop
                in an unexpected direction. People who expect to do one type of work may end up
                doing something completely different. This becomes a problem when team members
                want to develop their skills in a way that is different from that taken by the project.
                In those circumstances, you may decide that the team member should leave the team
                and find opportunities elsewhere. In this example, however, Alice decides to try to
                convince Dorothy that broadening her experience is a positive career step. She gives
                Dorothy more design autonomy and organizes training courses in software engineer
                ing that will give her more opportunities after her current project has finished.</p>
                <p>Maslow’s model of motivation is helpful up to a point but I think that a problem
                with it is that it takes an exclusively personal viewpoint on motivation. It does not
                take adequate account of the fact that people feel themselves to be part of an organization, 
                a professional group, and one or more cultures. This is not simply a question
                of satisfying social needs—people can be motivated through helping a group achieve
                shared goals.</p>
                <p>Being a member of a cohesive group is highly motivating for most people. People
                with fulfilling jobs often like to go to work because they are motivated by the people
                they work with and the work that they do. Therefore, as well as thinking about individual 
                motivation you also have to think about how a group as a whole can be motivated to achieve 
                =the organization’s goals. I discuss group management issues in the
                next section.</p>
                <p>Personality type also influences motivation. Bass and Dunteman (1963) classify
                professionals into three types:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Task-oriented people, who are motivated by the work they do. In software engineering, 
                    these are people who are motivated by the intellectual challenge of software development.</li>
                    <li>Self-oriented people, who are principally motivated by personal success and
                    recognition. They are interested in software development as a means of achieving their own goals. 
                    This does not mean that these people are selfish and think only of their own concerns. Rather, 
                    they often have longer-term goals, such as career progression, that motivate them and they wish 
                    to be successful in theirwork to help realize these goals.</li>
                    <li> Interaction-oriented people, who are motivated by the presence and actions of
                    co-workers. As software development becomes more user-centered, interactionoriented individuals 
                    are becoming more involved in software engineering.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>Interaction-oriented personalities usually like to work as part of a group, whereas
                task-oriented and self-oriented people usually prefer to act as individuals. Women
                are more likely to be interaction-oriented than men. They are often more effective
                communicators. I discuss the mix of these different personality types in groups in the
                case study in Figure 22.10.</p>
                <p>Each individual’s motivation is made up of elements of each class but one type
                of motivation is usually dominant at any one time. However, individuals can
                change. For example, technical people who feel they are not being properly
                rewarded can become self-oriented and put personal interests before technical concerns. 
                If a group works particularly well, self-oriented people can become more interaction-oriented.</p>

            <article>
                <p><b>22.3 Teamwork</b></p>
                <p>Most professional software is developed by project teams that range in size from two
                to several hundred people. However, as it is clearly impossible for everyone in a
                large group to work together on a single problem, large teams are usually split into
                a number of groups. Each group is responsible for developing part of the overall
                system. As a general rule, software engineering project groups should not have more
                than 10 members. When small groups are used, communication problems are
                reduced. Everyone knows everyone else and the whole group can get around a table
                for a meeting to discuss the project and the software that they are developing.</p>
                <p>Putting together a group that has the right balance of technical skills, experience,
                and personalities is a critical management task. However, successful groups are
                more than simply a collection of individuals with the right balance of skills. A good
                group is cohesive and has a team spirit. The people involved are motivated by the
                success of the group as well as by their own personal goals.</p>
                <p>In a cohesive group, members think of the group as more important than the individuals 
                who are group members. Members of a well-led, cohesive group are loyal tothe group. 
                They identify with group goals and other group members. They attempt to
                protect the group, as an entity, from outside interference. This makes the group
                robust and able to cope with problems and unexpected situations.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The group can establish its own quality standards Because these standards are
                    established by consensus, they are more likely to be observed than external standards imposed on the group.</li>
                    <li>Individuals learn from and support each other People in the group learn from
                      each other. Inhibitions caused by ignorance are minimized as mutual learning is
                      encouraged.</li>
                    <li>Knowledge is shared Continuity can be maintained if a group member leaves.
                      Others in the group can take over critical tasks and ensure that the project is not
                      unduly disrupted.</li>
                    <li>Refactoring and continual improvement is encouraged Group members work
                      collectively to deliver high-quality results and fix problems, irrespective of the
                      individuals who originally created the design or program.</li>
                </ol>
                      
                <img src="assets/figure-22.9.png" alt="" height="300px" width="600px">
                <p><b>Figure 22.9</b> Group cohesion</p>
                      
                <p>Good project managers should always try to encourage group cohesiveness. They
                may organize social events for group members and their families, try to establish a
                sense of group identity by naming the group and establishing a group identity and
                territory, or they may get involved in explicit group-building activities such as sports
                and games.</p>
                <p>One of the most effective ways of promoting cohesion is to be inclusive. This
                means that you should treat group members as responsible and trustworthy, and
                make information freely available. Sometimes, managers feel that they cannot reveal
                certain information to everyone in the group. This invariably creates a climate of
                mistrust. Simple information exchange is an effective way of making people feel val-
                ued and that they are part of a group.</p>
                <p>You can see an example of this in the case study in Figure 22.9. Alice arranges
                regular informal meetings where she tells the other group members what is going on.
                She makes a point of involving people in the product development by asking them to
                come up with new ideas derived from their own family experiences. The ‘away days’
                are also good ways of promoting cohesion—people relax together while they help
                each other learn about new technologies.</p>
                <p>Whether or not a group is effective depends, to some extent, on the nature of the
                project and the organization doing the work. If an organization is in a state of turmoil
                with constant reorganizations and job insecurity, it is very difficult for team members
                to focus on software development. However, apart from project and organizational
                issues, there are three generic factors that affect team working:</p> 
                <ol>
                    <li>The people in     the group You need a   mix of people in a    project group as       software
                    development involves   diverse activities    such as negotiating   with clients,          program-
                    ming, testing, and    documentation.</li>
                    <li>The group         organization A group   should be organized   so that individuals   can
                    contribute to the     best of their         abilities and tasks   can be completed as   expected.</li>
                    <li>Technical and     managerial            communications Good   communications        between
                    group members, and    between the software   engineering team and   other project

                  <p>As with all management issues, getting the right team cannot guarantee project
                  success. Too many other things can go wrong, including changes to the business and
                  the business environment. However, if you don’t pay attention to group composition,
                  organization, and communications, you increase the likelihood that your project will
                  run into difficulties.</p>
                  <p>22.3.1 Selecting group members</p>
                  <p>A manager or team leader’s job is to create a cohesive group and organize their
                  group so that they can work together effectively. This involves creating a group with
                  the right balance of technical skills and personalities, and organizing that group so
                  that the members work together effectively. Sometimes, people are hired from out-
                  side the organization; more often, however, software engineering groups are put
                  together from current employees who have experience on other projects. However,
                  managers rarely have a completely free hand in team selection. They often have to
                  use the people who are available in the company, even when they may not be the
                  ideal people for the job.</p>   
                  <p>As I discussed in Section 22.2.1, many software engineers are motivated prima-                      rily by their work. Software development groups, therefore, are often composed of
                  people who have their own ideas about how technical problems should be solved.
                  This is reflected in regularly reported problems of interface standards being ignored,
                  systems being redesigned as they are coded, unnecessary system embellishments,
                  and so on.</p>
                  <p>A group that has complementary personalities may work better than a group that
                  is selected solely on technical ability. People who are motivated by the work are
                  likely to be the strongest technically. People who are self-oriented will probably be
                  best at pushing the work forward to finish the job. People who are interaction-
                  oriented help facilitate communications within the group. I think that it is particu-
                  larly important to have interaction-oriented people in a group. They like to talk to
                  people and can detect tensions and disagreements at an early stage, before these have
                  a serious impact on the group.</p>
                  <p>In the case study in Figure 22.10, I have suggested how Alice, the project man-
                  ager, has tried to create a group with complementary personalities. This particular
                  group has a good mix of interaction- and task-oriented people but I have already dis-
                  cussed, in Figure 22.8, how Dorothy’s self-oriented personality has caused problems
                  because she has not been doing the work that she expected. Fred’s part-time role in
                  the group as a domain expert might also be a problem. He is mostly interested in technical challenges, so he may not interact well with other group members. The 
                  fact that he is not always part of the team means that he may not relate well to the
                  team’s goals.</p>

                  <p>Figure<b>22.10</b> Group composition</p>

                  <p>It is sometimes impossible to choose a group with complementary personalities.
                  If this is the case, the project manager has to control the group so that individual
                  goals do not take precedence over organizational and group objectives. This control
                  is easier to achieve if all group members participate in each stage of the project.
                  Individual initiative is most likely when group members are given instructions with-
                  out being aware of the part that their task plays in the overall project.</p>
                  <p>For example, say a software engineer is given a program design for coding and
                  notices what appears to be possible improvements that could be made to the design.
                  If he or she implements these improvements without understanding the rationale for
                  the original design, any changes, though well intentioned, might have adverse impli-
                  cations for other parts of the system. If all the members of the group are involved in
                  the design from the start, they will understand why design decisions have been made.
                  They may then identify with these decisions rather than oppose them.</p>

                  <ol>
                    <li>Should the project manager be the technical leader of the group? The technical
                  leader or system architect is responsible for the critical technical decisions made during software development. Sometimes, the project manager has the skill and
                  experience to take on this role. However, for large projects, it is best to appoint
                  a senior engineer to be the project architect, who will take responsibility for
                  technical leadership.</li>
                  <li>Who will be involved in making critical technical decisions, and how will these
                  be made? Will decisions be made by the system architect, the project manager,
                  or by reaching consensus amongst a wider range of team members?</li>
                  <li>How will interactions with external stakeholders and senior company manage-
                  ment be handled? In many cases, the project manager will be responsible for
                  these interactions, assisted by the system architect if there is one. However, an
                  alternative organizational model is to create a dedicated role concerned with
                  external liaison, and appoint someone with appropriate interaction skills to
                  that role.</li>
                  <li>How can groups integrate people who are not colocated? It is now common for
                  groups to include members from different organizations and people to work
                  from home as well as in a shared office. This has to be taken into account in
                  group decision-making processes.</li>
                  <li>How can knowledge be shared across the group? Group organization affects
                  information sharing as certain methods of organization are better for sharing
                  than others. However, you should avoid too much information sharing as people
                  become overloaded and excessive information distracts them from their work.</li>    
                </ol>
                      
                <p>Small programming groups are usually organized in a fairly informal way. The
              group leader gets involved in the software development with the other group mem-
                bers. In an informal group, the work to be carried out is discussed by the group as a
                whole, and tasks are allocated according to ability and experience. More senior
                group members may be responsible for the architectural design. However, detailed
                 design and implementation is the responsibility of the team member who is allocated
                to a particular task.</p>
                <p>Extreme programming groups (Beck, 2000) are always informal groups. XP
                enthusiasts claim that formal structure inhibits information exchange. In XP, manydecisions that are usually seen as management decisions (such as decisions on
                schedule) are devolved to group members. Programmers work together in pairs to
                develop code and take joint responsibility for the programs that are developed.</p>
                <p>Informal groups can be very successful, particularly when most group members
                are experienced and competent. Such a group makes decisions by consensus, which
                improves cohesiveness and performance. However, if a group is composed mostly of
                inexperienced or incompetent members, informality can be a hindrance because no
                definite authority exists to direct the work, causing a lack of coordination between
                group members and, possibly, eventual project failure.</p>
                <p>Hierarchical groups are groups that have a hierarchical structure with the group
                leader at the top of the hierarchy. He or she has more formal authority than the group
                members and so can direct their work. There is a clear organizational structure and
                decisions are made towards the top of the hierarchy and implemented by people
                lower down the hierarchy. Communications are primarily instructions from senior
                staff and there is relatively little ‘upward’ communication from the lower levels to
               the upper levels in the hierarchy.</p>  
                <p>This approach can work well when a well-understood problem can be easily
                broken into subproblems with subproblem solutions developed in different parts of
                the hierarchy. In those situations, relatively little communication across the hierar-
                chy is required. However, such situations are relatively rare in software engineering
               for the following reasons:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Changes to the software often require changes to several parts of the sy</li>
                  <li>Software technologies change so fast that more junior staff often know more
                  about the technology than experienced staff. Top-down communications may
                  mean that the project manager does not find out about the opportunities of using
                  new technologies. More junior staff may become frustrated because of what
                  they see as old-fashioned technologies being used for development.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>Democratic and hierarchic group organizations do not formally recognize that
                there may be very large differences in technical ability between group members. The
                best programmers may be up to 25 times more productive as the worst programmers.
                It makes sense to use the best people in the most effective way and to provide them
                with as much support as possible. An early organizational model that was intended
                to provide this support was the chief programmer team.</p>
                <p>To make the most effective use of highly skilled programmers, Baker (1972)
                and others (Aron, 1974; Brooks, 1975) suggested that teams should be built
                around an individual, highly skilled chief programmer. The underlying principle of
                the chief programmer team is that skilled and experienced staff should be respon-
                sible for all software development. They should not be concerned with routine
                matters and should have good technical and administrative support for their work.
                They should focus on the software to be developed and not spend a lot of time in
                external meetings.</p>
                <p>However, the chief programmer team organization is, in my view, overdependent
                on the chief programmer and their assistant. Other team members who are not given
                sufficient responsibility may become demotivated because they feel their skills are
                underused. They do not have the information to cope if things go wrong and are not
                given the opportunity to participate in decision making. There are significant project
                risks associated with this group organization and these may outweigh any benefits
                that this kind of organization might bring.</p>
                
                <p>22.3.3 Group communications</p>
                <hr />
                <p>It is absolutely essential that group members communicate effectively and efficiently
                with each other and with other project stakeholders. Group members must exchange
                information on the status of their work, the design decisions that have been made, and
                changes to previous design decisions. They have to resolve problems that arise with
                other stakeholders and inform these stakeholders of changes to the system, the group,
                and delivery plans. Good communication also helps strengthen group cohesiveness.
                Group members come to understand the motivations, strengths, and weaknesses of
                other people in the group.</p>
                <p>The effectiveness and efficiency of communications is influenced by</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Group size As a group gets bigger, it gets harder for members to communicate
                  effectively. The number of one-way communication links is n * (n  1), where
                  n is the group size, so, with a group of eight members, there are 56 possible
                  communication pathways. This means that it is quite possible that some people
                  will rarely communicate with each other. Status differences between group
                  members mean that communications are often one-way. Managers and experi-
                  enced engineers tend to dominate communications with less experienced staff,
                  who may be reluctant to start a conversation or make critical remarks.</li>
                  <li>Group structure People in informally structured groups communicate more
                  effectively than people in groups with a formal, hierarchical structure. In hierar-
                  chical groups, communications tend to flow up and down the hierarchy. People
                  at the same level may not talk to each other. This is a particular problem in a large project with several development groups. If people working on different
                  subsystems only communicate through their managers, then there are more
                  likely to be delays and misunderstandings.</li>
                  <li>Group composition People with the same personality types (discussed in
                  Section 22.2) may clash and, as a result, communications can be inhibited.
                  Communication is also usually better in mixed-sex groups (Marshall and
                  Heslin, 1975) than in single-sex groups. Women are often more interaction-
                  oriented than men and may act as interaction controllers and facilitators for the
                  group.</li>
                  <li>The physical work environment The organization of the workplace is a major
                  factor in facilitating or inhibiting communications. See the book’s webpage for
                  more information.</li>
                  <li>The available communication channels There are many different forms of
                  communication—face-to-face, e-mail messages, formal documents, tele-
                  phone, and Web 2.0 technologies such as social networking and wikis. As
                  project teams become increasingly distributed, with team members working
                  remotely, you need to make use of a range of technologies to facilitate
                  communications.</li>
                </ol>
                    
                <p>Project managers usually work to tight deadlines and, consequently, they may try to
                use communication channels that don’t take up too much of their time. They may
                therefore rely on meetings and formal documents to pass on information to project
                staff and stakeholders. Although this may be an efficient approach to communication
                from a project manager’s perspective, it is not usually very effective. There are often
                good reasons why people can’t attend meetings and so they don’t hear the presentation.
                Long documents are often never read because readers don’t know if the documents are
                relevant. When several versions of the same document are produced, readers find it
                difficult to keep track of the changes.</p>
                <p>Effective communication is achieved when communications are two way, and the
                people involved can discuss issues and information and establish a common under-
                standing of proposals and problems. This can be done through meetings, although
                these are often dominated by powerful personalities. It is sometimes impractical to
                arrange meetings at short notice. More and more project teams include remote mem-
                bers, which also makes meetings more difficult.</p>
                <p>To counter these problems, you may make use of web technologies such as wikis
                and blogs to support information exchange. Wikis support the collaborative
                creation and editing of documents, and blogs support threaded discussions about
                questions and comments made by group members. Wikis and blogs allow project
                members and external stakeholders to exchange information, irrespective of their
                location. They help manage information and keep track of discussion threads,
                which often become confusing when conducted by e-mail. You can also use instant
                messaging and teleconferences, which can be easily arranged, to resolve issues that
                need discussion.</p>
