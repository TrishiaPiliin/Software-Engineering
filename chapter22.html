      <p class="mb-3">The objective of this chapter is to introduce software project management and two important management activities, namely risk management and people management. When you have read the chapter you will:</p>
      <ul class="ul">
        <li>Know the principal tasks of software project managers;</li>
        <li>Understand the notion of risk management and some of the risks that can arise in software projects;</li>
        <li>Understand factors that influence personal motivation and what these might mean for software project managers;</li>
        <li>Understand key issues that influence team working, such as team composition, organization, and communication.</li>

        <p>Software project management is an essential part of software engineering. Projects need to be managed because professional software engineering is always subject to organizational budget and schedule constraints...</p>

        <p>The success criteria for project management obviously vary from project to project but, for most projects, important goals are:</p>
        <ol class="ol">
          <li>Deliver the software to the customer at the agreed time.</li>
          <li>Keep overall costs within budget.</li>
          <li>Deliver software that meets the customer's expectations.</li>
          <li>Maintain a happy and well-functioning development team.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>These goals are not unique to software engineering but are the goals of all engineering projects. However, software engineering is different from other types of engineering in a number of ways that make software management particularly challenging:</p>

        <ol class="ol">
          <li>
            <p class="font-semibold">The product is intangible</p>
            <p>Software cannot be seen or touched. Project managers rely on evidence rather than physical observation to assess progress.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p class="font-semibold">Large software projects are often ‘one-off’ projects</p>
            <p>Each project is different, so experience may not always predict new challenges—especially with rapid technological changes.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p class="font-semibold">Software processes are variable and organization-specific</p>
            <p>Unlike traditional engineering, software processes differ widely between organizations, making it hard to predict outcomes.</p>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>Because of these issues, it is not surprising that some software projects are late, over budget, or behind schedule...</p>

        <p>In this chapter, I focus on risk management and people management. Project planning is discussed in Chapter 23.</p>
